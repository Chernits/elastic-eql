# üõ°Ô∏è Detection Engineering Lab

Welcome to my **Detection Engineering Lab** ‚Äî a growing collection of detection rules, simulations, and threat analysis writeups based on real-world adversary behavior and blue team experience.

 I currently work in cybersecurity with **4 years of experience**, and I'm focused on building reliable detections for Windows, Linux, and cloud environments using SIEMs like [your SIEM here, e.g., Elastic or Sentinel].

Techniques Covered

- Process Injection
- PowerShell abuse (T1059.001)
- Credential Access
- Privilege Escalation
- Cloud resource abuse (coming soon)

Each detection is mapped to [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) and includes:
- Rule logic
- Sample logs or test results
- Simulation command (Atomic Red Team, manual tests)
- False positives & context
------
Tools Used

- SIEM: Elastic SIEM (ELK)
- Sigma + Sigmac
- Sysmon
