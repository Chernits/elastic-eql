# 🛡️ Detection Engineering Lab

Welcome to my **Detection Engineering Lab** — a growing collection of detection rules, simulations, and threat analysis writeups based on real-world adversary behavior and blue team experience.

🔍 I currently work in cybersecurity with **4 years of experience**, and I'm focused on building reliable detections for Windows, Linux, and cloud environments using SIEMs like [your SIEM here, e.g., Elastic or Sentinel].
